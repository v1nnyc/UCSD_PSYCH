		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<p>
			This is a research project being conducted by John Wixted and Laura Mickes at the University of California, San Diego. The purpose of this research project is to find out more about human memory. We are interested in studying these issues to
			increase
			our general understanding for human cognitive processes.
		</p>


		<h5> What will I be asked to do?</h5>
		<p>
			You have been asked to participate because you are interested in learning about research first hand. The procedure involves studying lists of words, faces, pictures, or short video clips on a computer screen. You will then ask to remember what

			stored with
			subjects data.

			This research is not designed to help you personally, but the results may help the investigator learn more about human memory. We hope that, in the mme, other people might benefit hom this study through improved understanding of human cognitive
			processes.
		</p>
